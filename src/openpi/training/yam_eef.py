"""Map YAM 14D joint actions into the 14D EEF layout the critic was pretrained on.

The YAM policy emits joint space (6 joints + 1 gripper per arm), but the critic was
pretrained on ``pos3 + euler3 + gripper`` per arm. Converting requires forward
kinematics, so this module reuses the FK implementation that produced the canonical
cartesian stream for these datasets rather than reimplementing the chain:
``rlds_dataset_builder/scratch/yam_fk.py`` (and its pinned ``vendor/yam_vendor_kin.xml``).

Two conventions are inherited from that module and must not drift:
  * the synthesized pose is the **flange** (``link6``), NOT a TCP — ABC-130k mixes
    gripper types with no per-episode label, so no single tool offset is correct;
  * rotations are emitted as extrinsic-xyz euler to match
    ``transforms.DeltaActions`` / ``AbsoluteActions``, which use
    ``Rotation.from_euler("xyz", ...)``.

Convert only AFTER the policy output transform has produced absolute, unnormalized
joint actions: FK on a delta or on normalized values is meaningless.
